# Vue window dimensions

> Declaratively use window dimensions in Vuejs

`vue-window-dimensions` is a Vue component that exposes the width and height of your browser window.

Please note that there are other libraries that try to solve this same problem. These, however, use a different API and often expose the dimensions as a global variable that updates on window resize. If this is more to your liking, check out [`vue-window-size`](https://github.com/mya-ake/vue-window-size) or [`vue-screen-size`](https://github.com/promosis/vue-screen-size).
